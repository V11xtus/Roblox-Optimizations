## R_EGENERATlON Optimizations:

First of all make a restore point, because if you don't like something you can always restore it. 
Another thing I'd like to say is that all these reg edit optimizations is what for me feels the best and has worked the best for me on performance, 
so I can not promise you it will work for you.
These optimizations aim at smoothness and optimizations.

This list excludes disabling services, because I am to lazy to add them here, because I already have a program that does that for me. 

Also this mainly for Roblox by the way(A lot of the optimizations are universal, however there are some extra focus points on roblox). ALSO I AM NOT LIABLE IF YOU FUCK UP YOUR PC OR IF YOU DONT SEE AN INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE EVERY PC IS DIFFERENT.


Anyways you can find the Guide in the readme.txt in the releases. I don't take credit btw. I made some of the programs like batch files created some of the registry edit files. 
This aims for game smoothness, reduced latency, optimized network and etc. 

If you have any questions you may DM me on discord r_eversal
